## About The Project

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of exercises based on the Udemy course "Bootstrap 4 From Scratch With 5 Projects" by Brad Traversy. The course was last updated in June 2018, and the exercises included here aim to reinforce key concepts of Bootstrap 4, including its grid system, components, utilities, and responsive design techniques.

Each exercise is structured to provide hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4, following best practices in front-end development.
