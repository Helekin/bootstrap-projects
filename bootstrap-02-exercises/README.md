## About The Project

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of exercises based on the Udemy course "Bootstrap 5: El Curso Completo, Pr√°ctico y Desde Cero" by Carlos Arturo Esparza. The course was last updated in July 2021, and the exercises included here aim to reinforce key concepts of Bootstrap 5, including its grid system, components, utilities, and responsive design techniques.

Each exercise is structured to provide hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4, following best practices in front-end development.
